# What is Fletch?

Fletch is a Java 1.0 compiler and virtual machine for the 6502 written in Rust.
It specifically targets [Ben Eater's breadboard 6502](https://eater.net/6502).
The compiler implementation is based on the 1988 edition of the [dragon book](https://suif.stanford.edu/dragonbook/) by Aho, Sethi, and Ullman.
I found my copy at a sidewalk library in San Francisco.
The Java implementation is based on the original edition of The Java<sup>TM</sup> Language Specification by Gosling, Joy, and Steele.
I probably got my copy from Borders when I was in high school in 1996.
Fletch is named after R.J. Fletcher, the antagonist from [the film UHF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UHF_(film)).
It is not intended to be practical.
